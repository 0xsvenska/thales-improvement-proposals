| TIP-169 | xThales incentives | Draft | fhd | only emit locked thales for LP incentives |  | 2024-11-15
 
## Simple Summary
 Introduce a new token contract, xThales. These tokens will be distributed in place of Thales incentives for providing liquidity.
 - Lock Y Thales for 52 weeks in the contract, and it will mint Y xThales tokens.
 - these tokens must be soul bound after being distributed as incentives
 - because these tokens are soulbound, there is no liquid price for them
 - xThales can be unlocked for Thales at any time:
 - within `26 weeks`: 75% burned, 25% unlocked
 - within `52 weeks`: 25% burned, 75% unlocked
 - after `52 weeks`: 100% unlocked
## Motivation
Currently, liquid emissions favor farmers. Introducing xThales as incentives would decrease farming by mercenaries and consequently increase farming by people who believe in the Thales protocol. This would also decrease the inflation of Thales, as there should be at least some people unlocking xThales early.
