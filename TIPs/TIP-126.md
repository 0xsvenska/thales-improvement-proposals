## Simple Summary

Reduce Overtime SafeBox fee to **2%** from existing 3% on both networks to enhance the odds competitiveness.

## Abstract

To increase the odds competitiveness and invite more users, this TIP proposes to reduce the SafeBox fee from 3% to **2%** on Overtime across Optimism and Arbitrum dapp deployments.

## Motivation

With the deployment of Fee Rebates program for Overtime on Optimism Network, it allowed for increase of SafeBox fee to 3% since all users were refunded the majority of it every two weeks in OP+THALES tokens, but it also had an effect of Overtime product having less competitive odds. To increase the runway of Fee Rebates program on Optimism further and to invite more users by providing more competitive odds across Optimism and Arbitrum deployments, this TIP proposes to reduce the SafeBox fee from 3% to **2%** across networks.

## Specification

This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to set the SafeBox fee percentage to `**2%**` on SportsAMM and ParlayAMM instances on Arbitrum and Optimism deployments.
