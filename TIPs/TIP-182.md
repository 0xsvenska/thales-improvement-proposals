TIP: 182 - Thales staking emissions halving

## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes the instantaneous staking emissions to “halve” from current 105K Thales weekly to 50K Thales weekly

## Abstract
This TIP proposes to set weekly staking rewards to 50K Thales for the week following implementation

## Motivation
Current Thales total emissions are approximately 4x the Thales buy-back-burn (BBB) rate, of which half are staking rewards, leading to continuous sell pressure from unaligned yield farmers that periodically sell their vested Thales. While we as a protocol are continually shifting LP focus from incentives to protocol owned liquidity, halving the staking rewards would make Thales token “staking emissions neutral”, whereby staking rewards will become fully offset by BBB. 

## Specification
Current Staking rewards for a total of 105K.

Proposed Staking rewards for a total of 50K with a 3:2 ratio of base rewards to bonus rewards (30K base, 20K bonus) distributed to individual chains as per TIP 181. 

Emissions decay of 0.5% weekly approved in TIP 176 will remain. 

## Rationale
Thales staking emissions halving has both a marketing twist (BTC Halving!) and leads to decreased selling pressure from unaligned Thales yield farmers. Improved Thales token emissions to BBB ratio with an expected continual growth in BBB will hopefully lead to Thales token price stabilisation and potentially attract new investors.
