## Abstract

This TIP proposes to add markets for individual player props on Overtime.
 
## Motivation
 
Overtime has been running successfully for more than a year now. The volume is continuously growing, and the AMM is profitable. Over the past 13 months, many new sports have been added along with various types of markets, including double chances, spreads, totals, and single-game parlays. Now, the time has come for the next step: the addition of player props markets.

According to reports from relevant institutions, player props have accounted for 38% of all sportsbook volume. This is a substantial portion of activity that cannot be ignored. Overtime's odds providers are finally prepared to offer these types of markets themselves. Therefore, I propose their addition at the start of the upcoming seasons.

Player props are intriguing in the way they provide much more variety. You can select a specific player and explore numerous markets related to that player. For instance, in the case of an NBA player, you can consider points, assists, rebounds, and more. In this particular market, you decide whether the outcome will be OVER or UNDER a designated line. For instance, you can bet on whether LeBron James will score OVER or UNDER 27.5 points. The odds for these two options are generally balanced, similar to total points markets, ensuring more competitive odds for users. Both the over and under options are likely to have odds of around 50%, and the line is the variable that will adjust.

Because not only the odds but also the specific thresholds change on the data provider's side as a given game approaches, we need to implement these markets differently than regular moneyline markets. This approach will be akin to how total markers are handled. Further details are available in the specification section.

The initial rollout is planned to coincide with the start of the 2023/2024 NFL season. Support for other leagues and sports is anticipated to be added later (NBA, MLB, NHL, etc.).
## Specification 

Example game:  
NBA Lakers vs Clippers

Market:
LeBron James - 27.5 points 
     
Player prop points: Threshold = 27.5: will resolve as OVER if players total points in a game surpasses 27.5, or UNDER otherwise.

Assumption is that all markets are resolved with results after overtimes (for binary sports, not for soccer).  

The splineread can change as we get closer to the game, e.g. the following can be a sequence of data chronologically as we get it from the oracle:  
- Lebron James (27.5) 
- Lebron James (26.5)   
- Lebron James (27.5)   
- Lebron James (29.5)  

Every time the line changes we create a new market and pause the previous one. Due to implementation complexity the skew and caps are reset every time a new market is created, so for the MVP release we will start with managable caps to not risk all AMM liquidity on a single game.  
If a line reappears (27.5 in the example above), we will reaactivate the market that has been previously created.  

Each player props will have a reference to the parent market which is the one currently known as moneyline.  All markets are resolved in a single method as we get the results from the oracle inclusive of exact points scored per team. ?? 

Per previously established rules a Parlay can only have one prop from a specific player in a ticket. Combining the outcome of the game with a player prop from that same game also will not be possible.

Examples:

2 games 
LA Lakers vs Denver Nuggets
Miami Heat - Toronto Raptors

Invalid
LeBron James points (27.5) OVER
LeBron James rebounds (6.5) OVER

Invalid:
LeBron James points (27.5) OVER
LA Lakers WIN

Valid:
LeBron James points (27.5) OVER
Miami Heat WIN

Valid:
LeBron James points (27.5) OVER
Anthony Davis points (21.5) OVER

Valid:
LeBron James points (27.5) OVER
Jimmy Butler points (25.5) UNDER
