| TIP-140 | Remove AMM LP caps and increase AMM LP allowance | Draft  | BigPenny(@RealBigPenny) | Remove AMM LP caps and increase AMM LP allowance | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2023-04-26 |

## Abstract

Allow $THALES stakers to provide "unlimited" AMM liquidity and increase their allowance.

## Simple Summary

This TIP proposes to remove the cap for AMM LP deposits and to reduce the ratio between staked $THALES and AMM LP allowance from 10:1 to 5:1. 

## Motivation

Caps on AMM LPs were introduced to reduce risk for AMM liquidity providers while AMM LP contracts where still new and untested. With AMM LP contracts now well tested and considered to be safe up to the reasonable amount of general smart contract risk, it is time to remove deposit caps so all stakers can provide liquidity up to their individual allowance.
For the same reason the ratio between $THALES staked and AMM LP allowance shall be reduced from 10:1 to 5:1 to allow stakers to supply more liquidity.

## Specification

1. Deposit caps on all AMM liquidity pools are removed.
2. Reduce ratio between $THALES staked and AMM LP allowance from 10:1 to 5:1.
