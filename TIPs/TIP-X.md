&lt;TIP title&gt;
=================

This is the template for TIPs.

Note that an TIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your TIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, TIP-draft\_title\_abbrev.md.

The title should be 44 characters or less.

Simple Summary[#](#simple-summary "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the TIP.

Abstract[#](#abstract "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

Motivation[#](#motivation "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

The motivation is critical for TIPs that want to change Thales. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the TIP solves. TIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

Specification[#](#specification "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------------

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

Rationale[#](#rationale "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Test Cases[#](#test-cases "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for TIPs but can be included with the implementation.

Implementation[#](#implementation "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------

The implementations must be completed before any TIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the TIP is "Approved".

While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of TIP details.
