| TIP-142 | Parlay AMM LP solution| Draft | Danijel | Implement Parlay AMM LPing solution | https://discord.gg/thales | 2023-05-07

## Simple Summary

This TIP proposes to implement a liqudity providing solution that allows THALES stakers to deposit into Parlay AMM.

## Motivation

With successfull released of TIP-99 and TIP-139 that allowed users to deposit into SportsAMM and ThalesAMM respectively, and having completed a smart contract audit, we now want to expand the LPing offering by opening up ParlayAMM for deposits.  
ParlayAMM has been consistently profitable across both Optimism and Arbitrum chains.

## Specification

The base approach will remain the same as established with TIP-99. The key difference beeing that due to the nature of the Parlays, some games on a ticket may be from one round, but others from another round. In such cases, DefaultLiquidityProvider will be used to provide liquidity for such parlays from mixed rounds, and the said parlays will be directly exercised into the DefaultLiquidityProvider.
