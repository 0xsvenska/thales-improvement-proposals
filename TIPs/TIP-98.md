| TIP-98 | Deprecate Exotic Markets  | Draft | Danijel (@danthales)| Pause market creation on Exotic and disform Oracle Council  | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2022-10-20
 
## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes a plan to deprecate Exotic Markets 
 

## Motivation
 
While I personally still believe and love the idea of permissionless prediction markets, I find that the numbers since Exotic has been released and to date, do not justify further investments into it, specially considering how Overtime fared in comparison.  

- Exotic Volume in 6 months $100,000  
- Overtime Volume in 3 months $1,500,000  

The costs of running Exotic include 15,000 THALES a month for Oracle Council but also resourcing costs for development, marketing, comms, infrastructure, etc...    

I fully believe that if we focus all our might on Exotic, we would find ways to make it successful, but unfortunately as resources are limited, it's my inclination to go with more likely winners, which Overtime seems to be.    
Exotic contracts and all code still belongs to Thales DAO and can come back in one way or the other, e.g. as part of Overtime's offering.       

## Specification
- Disable creation of new Exotic markets
- Setup Protocol Dao in place of Oracle Council to support markets that mature before the end of 2022  
- All markets that are set to mature after 2022 are to be cancelled and participants refunded
