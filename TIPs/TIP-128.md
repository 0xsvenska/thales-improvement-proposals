| TIP-127 | Allow treasury to purchase and burn discounted CC tokens | Draft | Danijel (@danthales) | Allow treasury to purchase and burn discounted CC tokens | https://discord.gg/thales | 2023-2-17

## Simple Summary

Allow treasury to purchase treasury tokens at 30% discount from min(30 days twap, current price) and burn those tokens.

## Motivation

In [TIP-9](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-9.md) we established a clear guideline that no CC is allowed to market sell his/her CC allocation. 
This is a rule not many DAOs endorse and a commendable one at that, and I firmly believe in its value and want to continue ensuring its beeing adheered to, I feel compelled to also consider individual CC motivation and how to ensure they remain motivated and happy while resisting the urge to liquidity any of their CC allocation to the open market. 

The original idea was focusing on OTC trades with trusted potential investors. This idea still remains viable, but I currently feel its not very likely that there is enough demand for such OTC trades for this to currently be a realistic option. 

I want to propose an approach where CCs have a way to liquidate small chunks of their allocation at discount by doing OTC trades with the treasury. The benefit for the protocol here is twofold:  
1. No CC tokens end up in open market  
2. The total circulating supply is reduced by burning those tokens  

## Specification

The discount would be 30% for the minimum of two values - 30 days twap or current price. 
A trade can only be allowed if the treasury runway per current cost estimates remains at least 3 years or higher after the trade.  
A CC can not liquidate more than 5% of his/her allocation in a quarter in this manner.
