## Simple Summary
This TIP aims to formalize the new DAO token and this way streamline future processes of CEX listings, fast bridging integrations and similar.
## Abstract
After the successful migration of THALES token to the new token contract and to new token related contracts on Optimism, this TIP proposes to formalize the new THALES token contract as the official DAO token and this way streamline future token related processes such as CEX listings, fast-bridge integrations and similar.
## Motivation
Since deployment in early 2022, the THALES token migration to Optimism was a seamless "one-txn" experience that included migrating the THALES token to the new token contract and bridging it to Optimism. This transition had few important beneficial impacts: it provided an elegant solution for the Core Contributor allocation lock-up incident and it migrated all relevant THALES token operations (staking and LP incentives) to a fast and cheap environment. Now that there are no more LP incentives for the old token on L1 and that the majority of the supply and liquidity is on Optimism layer 2 network in the form of the new token contract, it is time to formally acknowledge the new token contract as the main official DAO token.  
  
This formalization will allow the new THALES token to build a presence on L1 and potentially other networks in the future, without any complication and confusion that could derive from having the legacy token and the new THALES token present at the same network. This formalization is also a necessity if we are to facilitate future CEX listings, fast-bridge solution partnerships and other various potential integrations that require spotless clarity around the official DAO token.  
  
This TIP should also serve as an invitation to all legacy THALES token holders, which doesn't have any type of support anymore except the migration tool, to migrate to the new THALES token contract as the official DAO token and gain access to all of the supported accompanying utilities that come with it.  

## Specification

This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to support the new THALES token as official DAO token that has the following addresses:  
- THALES token contract on **Optimism**: [0x217d47011b23bb961eb6d93ca9945b7501a5bb11](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x217d47011b23bb961eb6d93ca9945b7501a5bb11)
- THALES token contract on **Ethereum mainnet**: [0x8947da500Eb47F82df21143D0C01A29862a8C3c5](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8947da500Eb47F82df21143D0C01A29862a8C3c5)
