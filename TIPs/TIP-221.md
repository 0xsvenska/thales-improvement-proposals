| TIP-221 | Change referral rewards | Draft | holmberg | Pay referral rewards only from losing bets | discordlink | 2024-08-06

## Simple Summary
Change the referral much closer to the normal industry standard and also prevent abuse.

## Motivation
Thales referral affects small odds proportionally more than large ones. We have not faced problems yet, but that might be a problem in the future. 

## Specification
Referral reward is paid currently from winning and losing positions. In small risk positions where implied probability is >95% referral effect is from 10% to 50%. There might be a chance for abuse use.
I suggest that in the future referral reward is paid only for lost positions in all Thales products. This is closer to the industry standard and eliminates the possibility of abusive use.
However, for the referral fees to remain attractive and at the same level, the basic level must be raised to 1%.
