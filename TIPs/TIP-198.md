| TIP-198 | Bridge Thales using CCIP | Draft | Kiril (Thales) | Use CCIP to bridge THALES across all supported networks | [discordlink ](https://discord.gg/thales)   | 2024-03-20 |


## Simple Summary


Use Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to bridge THALES token across all supported networks.


## Abstract

Chainlink CCIP has proven as a reliable protocol which can be used as a secure bridge along current bridging.  
THALES token holders may benefit from lower fees without compensating security.


## Motivation

Currently Celer bridge, native OP bridge and other bridge aggregators are used for bridging THALES token.

After successful implementaion of [TIP-181](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-181.md), this TIP proposes the use of Chainlink CCIP to enable THALES token holders to bridge accross all supported network. The idea is to provide multiple secure bridging options for THALES token holders. Chainlink CCIP operates at the highest level of cross-chain security by taking a defense-in-depth approach, where multiple decentralized oracle networks and an independent Risk Management Network secure each transaction.

The implementation details are laid in the specification

## Specification

New *ThalesBridgePool* contracts are deployed on every supported network. Each *ThalesBridgePool* contract is pre-loaded with THALES tokens.  
A user initiates bridging of THALES tokens from origin network by depositing *X* amount of THALES to the origin *ThalesBridgePool* and triggering a CCIP message to be sent to a destination *ThalesBridgePool* on destination network. Upon successful CCIP messaging, the destination *ThalesBridgePool* transfers *X* amount of THALES to the user address on the destination network.  
Note: the destination address can differ from the user address and can be arbitrary chosen.

For example, if user decides to bridge from Optimism to Arbitrum network an amount of 100 THALES:

1. The user approves *ThalesBridgePool* on Optimism.
2. The user triggers bridging function that deposits 100 THALES to the *ThalesBridgePool* on Optimism
3. The Optimism *ThalesBridgePool* generates a CCIP message that is sent to Arbitrum *ThalesBridgePool*.
4. The Arbitrum *ThalesBridgePool* receives the message and obtains a destination address.
5. The Arbitrum *ThalesBridgePool* transfers 100 THALES to the destination address.

## Test Cases

- Bridge between OP Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia


## Implementation

- ThalesBridgePool contract - perform cross-chain messaging and holds pool of THALES tokens.
