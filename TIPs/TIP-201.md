| TIP-201 | Staking Rewards Tapering | Draft | MrBreakout (@MrBreakout) | Thales staking rewards halving | https://discord.gg/thales | 2024-05-11


## Simple Summary

Thales staking rewards halving

## Abstract

This TIP proposes the instantaneous staking rewards to “halve” from current 40K Thales weekly to 20K Thales weekly

  
## Motivation
 
Current objective of this tapering is to be able to buyback and burn below the weekly inflation or getting close to that.
Treasury is buying back and burning 1400 USD worth of thales tokens which is around 37k tokens at current price range.
We are distributing 40k thales tokens for stakers and 29,500 thales tokens for LPs per week. Hence if we could cut the inflation half we could buyback and burn more than inflation. 

TIP-200 decreases LP incentives to 19,500 tokens per week. 

If this proposal gets approved it will decrease total token emissions from weekly 69,500 tokens to 39,500 tokens which is overall %43 drop from current set up.


## Specification 

Current Staking rewards is at 40K per week

This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate proposed staking rewards for a total of 20K with a 3:2 ratio of base rewards to bonus rewards (12K base, 8K bonus) distributed to individual chains as per TIP 181.
