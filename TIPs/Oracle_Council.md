### Market creation Guidelines
Every market must be created according to the following guidelines. The list of guidelines is preliminary and after Oracle Council is voted in its their duty to complement it and update it as new edge cases are discovered.  
Not adhering to these guidelines can be a subject of a dispute:
- Market question has to be precise, written in English language and free of any ambiguity
- Market has to be mainstream and verifiable via data sources parameter.
- The list of available positions has to be mutually fully exclusive and capture the full range of potential outcomes
- End of positioning phase has to be before the event actually starts
- End of positioning must not be more than 1 month into the future
- Market resolution/question should not be more than 2 months into the future
- The market must not be theoretically resolvable with any of the offered positions before the end of positioning
- No morbid, racist, death related markets or otherwise malicious markets are allowed and will be disputed and slashed
- The market has to be linkable to at least one of the offered tags maintained by Oracle Council
- No duplicated markets should be created. Its ok to create more markets around the same event, but with a different sentiment (different question and/or positions).
