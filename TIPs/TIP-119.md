## Simple Summary
 
Add XAU/USD and XAG/USD price feeds from Chainlink to Thales and enable market creation around those assets price feeds on Optimism.
 
## Abstract
 
To diversify Thales Marketplace offering from exclusively crypto assets, this TIP proposes to integrate XAU and XAG price feeds into PriceFeed.sol contract and thus enable market creation around those assets on the Thales marketplace. This TIP additionally proposes to enable a "market close" mechanism for XAU and XAG markets so to be syncronised with global XAU and XAG market close times.
 
## Motivation
 

 
## Specification
 
This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to integrate the following Chainlink Optimism data feeds into Thales smart contracts and this way enable creation of markets around these assets:
 
 - XAU/USD  (Proxy: [0x8F7bFb42Bf7421c2b34AAD619be4654bFa7B3B8B](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x8F7bFb42Bf7421c2b34AAD619be4654bFa7B3B8B)) 
 - XAG/USD  (Proxy: [0x290dd71254874f0d4356443607cb8234958dee49](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x290dd71254874f0d4356443607cb8234958dee49))

This TIP additionally entails Thales Protocol DAO to implement a solution for market close
