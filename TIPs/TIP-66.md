## Simple Summary

This TIP proposes to enable auto-claiming of THALES staking rewards to improve user experience.

## Abstract

Currently THALES staking rewards need to be claimed weekly or they are forfeited and returned to treasury. This TIP proposes to enable auto-claiming of THALES staking rewards to improve UX and avoid THALES stakers missing rewards for inactivity that surpasses duration of one week.

## Motivation

There is no protocol relevant reason to keep claiming of weekly staking rewards mandatory so to accrue rewards. One positive case for mandatory weekly claiming is that it makes people interact with the protocol on a weekly level, but the more impactful countereffect is that stakers feel forced and pressured to reach the snapshot deadline. This mechanism can potentially disincentivize THALES stakers and overall have a negative effect on overall user experience.  
  
**Enabling auto-claiming also keep Protocol Users and SNX stakers always compounding higher rewards and increasing their overall percentage of THALES total supply via Gamified Staking, compared to passive THALES stakers that only accrue base staking rewards.**

## Specification

This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to implement auto-claiming for THALES stakers.
