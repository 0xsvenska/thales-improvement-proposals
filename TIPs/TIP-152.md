## Simple Summary
 
Set `_minSupportedOdds` to `0.033` and hence increase the max win cap from 20x to 33x.

## Abstract

Until this point, the max possible return on Overtime Markets is capped at 20x from Buy-In. With the product maturing and new offerings popping up, it is safe to increase the cap on max possible return to 30x by changing the `_minSupportedOdds` to `0.033` from the current `0.05` and hence significantly increase the UX and the product offering.

## Motivation

With new sports and position types being added to Overtime, the need for higher cap on potential return follows it. With the sharpness of odds and the AMM performance proving itself day by day, this parameter change is deemed safe for the AMM and the liquidity pool. By increasing the max potential return cap to 30x, there are more offerings available to users that offer higher risk but higher return. It adds to the betterment of UX of Overtime and has a potential to invite more new users to the platform.

## Specification

This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to set `_minSupportedOdds` to `0.033` on the [`SportsAMM`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x170a5714112daEfF20E798B6e92e25B86Ea603C1#writeProxyContract) contract.
