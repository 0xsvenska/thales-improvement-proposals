| TIP-105 | Reduce SafeBox fee for vaults| Draft | Danijel | Reduce or remove SafeBox fee when Vaults are buying from the AMMs  | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2022-11-21


## Abstract

This TIP proposes to either reduce SafeBox fee to 1% when Vaults are buying from Thales or Overtime AMMs or to remove it completely (the proposed choice is subject to governance feedback). 
 
## Motivation
 
With the Overtime vaults released recently and Thales vaults being released very soon, its clear to me that for those vaults to be efficient and profitable, thus attractive to depositors, we should reduce their fees.  

On Overtime specifically its not that often that there are enough discounted positions that meet the conditions the specific vaults have, or for those that are, with the SafeBox fees applied, the vaults would still not be profitable long term based on math and theory of big numbers and correct odds alone.

As Vaults are purely beneficial to the protocol as they balance the AMM risks and increase our TVL, I think it's in our interest to either forfeit the SafeBox fees when the Vaults are buying positions or reduce the SafeBox fee to 1% from 3%.  

If the vaults do end up being profitable with this change in effect, we could introduce a dedicated vault fee, but at the moment I feel its more important to make sure the vaults are attractive and efficient.     

## Specification 

Option 1: Reduce SafeBox fees for Vaults when buying from AMMs from 3% to 1%
