## Simple Summary

Additional tapering of AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incetivized LPs.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes additional tapering of AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incetivized LPs.

New reward structure to be:  

- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: `20,000 THALES + 1,500 OP` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `3,000 THALES` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: `5,000 THALES + 500 OP` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `3,000 THALES` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/USDbC pool bribes: `5,000 THALES` per week  
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: `3,000 THALES` per week

These emissions are to run for **8 weeks** until further revaluation.  
  
## Motivation
 
Currently, THALES onchain liquidity is relatively deep and more than sufficient, at over $4m TVL. This includes protocol owned liquidy primarily in the THALES/WETH pool. Given this fact, this TIP suggests to decrease ongoing incentives / bribes, with a higher reduction on the /WETH pairs in comparison to the USDC pairs. 

## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
  
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: `20,000 THALES + 1,500 OP` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `3,000 THALES` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: `5,000 THALES + 500 OP` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `3,000 THALES` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/USDbC pool bribes: `5,000 THALES` per week  
- Arbtirum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: `5,000 THALES` per week

The incentives in this proposal are to be valid for a period of `8 weeks` from implementation.
