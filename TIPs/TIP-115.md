| TIP-115 | Deploy Overtime to Arbitrum | Draft | Danijel (@danthales) |  Deploy Overtime to Arbitrum| https://discord.gg/thales | 2022-12-17
 
## Simple Summary

This TIP proposes a native deployment of Overtime to Arbitrum chain 
 
## Motivation

With Overtime being live for 5 months on Optimism and driving more than 10m notional volume, I believe we are now well positioned to expand to another chain.  
The Oracle rework proposed in TIP-114 has most of my previous concerns are mitigated (cost scalling, frontrunning at doubled liquidity).  

With Overtime adding spread, totals and double chance markets, its offering is now diverse enough to be on par with centralized sport books.   

The choice of Arbitrum is driven by the general momentum of that chain, but also due to the support Arbitrum has been giving and is willing to give Thales DAO and specifically Overtime should it deploy there.
    
## Specification 

Deploy all Overtime related contracts to Arbitrum. The collateral would be USDC until sUSD is available on Arbitrum. Curve onramp for other stable coins would not be initially supported.
